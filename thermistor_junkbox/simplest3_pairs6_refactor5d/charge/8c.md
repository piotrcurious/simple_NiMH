The storeResistanceData function stores data in the std::vector<DataPoint> object that is passed to it as the data argument. Let's break down where these vectors are likely located and how they are accessible:

1. Where the Data is Stored:

The storeResistanceData function has the following signature:
C++

void storeResistanceData(float current, float resistance, int dc, std::vector<DataPoint>& data, int& count)
The fourth argument, std::vector<DataPoint>& data, is a reference to a std::vector of DataPoint objects. This means that when storeResistanceData is called, it receives a direct link to an existing vector in memory.
The function then adds a new DataPoint (containing current, resistance, and dc) to this vector using either direct assignment if count is within the vector's current size, or by using push_back() to append a new element if count reaches the current size.
2. How the Data is Accessible by Other Functions:

The accessibility of the data stored by storeResistanceData depends on how the std::vector object passed to it is declared and managed. Based on how storeResistanceData is used in the provided code, we can infer the following:

internalResistanceData: This vector is used in the measureInternalResistanceLoadedUnloaded function:

C++

storeResistanceData(loadedData.current, std::abs(internalResistance), dc, internalResistanceData, resistanceDataCount);
And it is accessed in the estimateSaturationDutyCycle function within chargeBattery():

C++

if (internalResistanceData.size() >= 2) {
    // ... access elements of internalResistanceData ...
}
This indicates that internalResistanceData is likely declared as a global variable or at least a variable with a scope that is accessible by both measureInternalResistanceLoadedUnloaded and chargeBattery. Global variables are declared outside of any function and can be accessed from any part of the code. 1  Â

internalResistanceDataPairs: This vector is used in the measureInternalResistancePairs function:

C++

storeResistanceData(highData.current, std::abs(internalResistanceConsecutive), dcHigh, internalResistanceDataPairs, resistanceDataCountPairs);
And it is also accessed in the estimateSaturationDutyCycle function within chargeBattery():

C++

if (internalResistanceDataPairs.size() < 2) {
    // ... check size of internalResistanceDataPairs ...
}
// ... iterate through internalResistanceDataPairs ...
Similar to internalResistanceData, this implies that internalResistanceDataPairs is also likely a global variable or has a scope accessible by both measureInternalResistancePairs and chargeBattery.

In summary:

The storeResistanceData function itself doesn't "own" the data. It populates a vector that is passed to it. In this code, the vectors internalResistanceData and internalResistanceDataPairs are likely global variables (declared outside of any function). This makes them accessible by any function in the code, including measureInternalResistanceLoadedUnloaded, measureInternalResistancePairs, and chargeBattery, allowing the data collected during the internal resistance measurement to be used later in the charging process.

Example of how these global variables might be declared (though not explicitly shown in the provided snippets):

C++

#include <vector>

// ... other includes and definitions ...

namespace {
// ... other namespace variables ...
struct DataPoint {
    float current;
    float resistance;
    int dutyCycle;
};

std::vector<DataPoint> internalResistanceData;
int resistanceDataCount = 0;
std::vector<DataPoint> internalResistanceDataPairs;
int resistanceDataCountPairs = 0;
std::vector<float> unloadedVoltagesHistory;
float averageInternalResistance = -1.0f;
// ... other namespace variables ...
}

// ... function definitions (measureInternalResistanceLoadedUnloaded, measureInternalResistancePairs, chargeBattery, etc.) ...
By declaring internalResistanceData and internalResistanceDataPairs in the global namespace (or within a namespace that encompasses the relevant functions), they can be accessed and modified by any function that needs to interact with the stored resistance data.
