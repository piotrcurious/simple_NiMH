Key Improvements:

Modified DataPoint: The DataPoint struct now includes an int dutyCycle member to store the duty cycle at which the measurement was taken.
Updated takeMeasurement(): The takeMeasurement() function now returns the MeasurementData which includes the dutyCycle.
Updated storeResistanceData(): This function now accepts and stores the dutyCycle along with current and resistance.
Updated measureInternalResistanceLoadedUnloaded() and measureInternalResistancePairs(): The calls to storeResistanceData() in these functions are updated to pass the corresponding duty cycle.
estimateSaturationDutyCycle() Function:
This new function iterates through the internalResistanceDataPairs.
For each data point in internalResistanceDataPairs, it tries to find a corresponding data point in internalResistanceData with a similar current (within a small tolerance).
It then checks if the resistance from the "pairs" method is significantly higher (using a resistanceThresholdMultiplier) than the resistance from the "loaded/unloaded" method.
If such a condition is met, the duty cycle associated with the "pairs" measurement is considered a potential saturation duty cycle and is returned.
If no clear saturation point is found based on the threshold, the function defaults to MAX_CHARGE_DUTY_CYCLE.
Using Estimated Duty Cycle in chargeBattery(): The chargeBattery() function now calls estimateSaturationDutyCycle() to get an estimate for SATURATION_DUTY_CYCLE. This estimated value is then used to calculate HIGH_CHARGE_DUTY_CYCLE.
Important Notes and Adjustments:

resistanceThresholdMultiplier: The value 1.5f in estimateSaturationDutyCycle() is an example. You might need to adjust this threshold based on the specific behavior of your MH battery to accurately detect saturation.
Current Matching Tolerance: The 0.02f tolerance for matching currents between the two datasets might need adjustment depending on the resolution and consistency of your measurements.
Saturation Detection Logic: The current saturation detection logic is a simple heuristic. More sophisticated methods might involve analyzing the trends of the resistance values or looking for specific inflection points.
Experimentation: You will likely need to experiment with the resistanceThresholdMultiplier and potentially refine the estimateSaturationDutyCycle() function based on the data you collect from your battery.
With these changes, the chargeBattery() function now attempts to automatically estimate the saturation duty cycle based on the internal resistance measurements, making the determination of the "high" charging current more dynamic. Remember to thoroughly test and adjust the parameters for optimal performance with your specific battery.
