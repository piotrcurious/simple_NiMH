tools to read thermistors.

one thermistor is used to read ambient temperature , with usual series resistor

next thermistors are used to read temperature difference inbetween ambient and the battery: top thermistor is thermally coupled with ambient temperature thermistor and is used instead of series resistor, bottom thermistor is thermally coupled to battery and is used to measure difference. output is ratiometric.
