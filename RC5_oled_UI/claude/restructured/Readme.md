I'll reorganize the code with better structure, separating concerns and improving modularity.




Key improvements in the restructured code:

1. Better Separation of Concerns:
   - Hardware abstraction layer
   - Dedicated channel management
   - UI management separate from data handling
   - Configuration centralized in one place

2. More Modular Design:
   - Each major component in its own header file
   - Base classes for extensibility
   - Clear interface boundaries
   - Dependency injection pattern

3. Improved Type Safety:
   - Proper enums for states and commands
   - Strong typing for configuration constants
   - Better encapsulation of internal data

4. Better Resource Management:
   - Smart pointers for screen management
   - RAII principles
   - Virtual destructors where needed
   - Const correctness

5. More Maintainable Structure:
   - Configuration separated from implementation
   - Clear update cycles
   - Easier to modify individual components
   - Better error handling potential

Would you like me to:
1. Add more error handling?
2. Implement the remaining screen classes?
3. Add configuration persistence?
4. Add diagnostic features?
