I'll continue with the rest of the enhanced battery charger UI code.



This enhanced version adds several important features:

1. Comprehensive Charge Monitoring:
   - Peak voltage detection
   - -Î”V termination
   - Temperature monitoring
   - Capacity calculation
   - Multiple termination conditions

2. Enhanced UI Features:
   - Better battery symbols with charge level indication
   - Rolling graphs for voltage and current
   - Detailed channel statistics
   - Maintenance mode with pulse charging
   - Status indicators and symbols

3. Improved Control:
   - PWM-based current control
   - Multiple charge termination methods
   - Safe charging timeouts
   - Temperature monitoring
   - Regular sensor updates

4. Maintenance Features:
   - Real-time voltage monitoring
   - Configurable current pulses
   - Automatic pulse timing
   - Historical data graphing

To use additional features:
1. Press 1-4 to select channels
2. Use Up/Down to navigate
3. Select to enter detailed view
4. Plus/Minus to adjust current
5. Back to return to main screen

Would you like me to:
1. Add more configuration options?
2. Implement the settings screen?
3. Add more safety features?
4. Enhance the graphing capabilities?
