## Key Algorithmic Improvements

1. **Adaptive Active Set Management**: Dynamically shrinks and expands the working set to focus computation on the most promising examples.

2. **Second-Order Optimization**: Incorporates curvature information with expected gain estimation to accelerate convergence.

3. **Enhanced Working Set Selection**: Multiple heuristics including recent success caching, stratified selection based on boundary proximity, and adaptive weighting.

4. **Sigmoid-Based Residual Weighting**: Uses a sigmoid function to enhance the contrast between high and low residuals, giving better focus to the most problematic points.

5. **Efficient Kernel Caching**: Thread-local storage with fast hashing for pair indices and prefetching hints for cache efficiency.

6. **Robust Bias Updates**: Weighted averaging of multiple bias candidates based on their reliability.

7. **Advanced Convergence Tracking**: Multiple metrics including unchanged count, progress rate, and adaptive termination criteria.

8. **Numerical Stability Enhancements**: Buffer zones near bounds, regularization for near-singular kernel matrices, and careful handling of degenerate cases.

These improvements should significantly enhance the efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the SMO algorithm for polynomial fitting, particularly on difficult datasets with outliers or non-uniform distributions.
